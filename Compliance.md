# Compliance Guidelines

## X (Twitter) Terms of Service Compliance

This platform is designed to be fully compliant with X's Terms of Service. We do not engage in any pay-for-engagement schemes that violate X's policies.

### Key Compliance Principles

1. **No Pay-for-Engagement**: We do not pay users for likes, retweets, comments, or follows. We pay for content deliverables only.

2. **Content-Focused Payments**: Payments are made for:
   - Creating and publishing content
   - Meeting specific campaign requirements
   - Providing proof of work
   - NOT for engagement metrics

3. **Transparent Disclosure**: All sponsored content must include proper disclosure:
   - #ad hashtag
   - "Sponsored" text
   - Clear indication of paid partnership

4. **Read-Only Metrics**: We only observe public metrics for:
   - Analytics and reporting
   - Relative bonus calculations
   - Campaign performance insights
   - NOT for direct payment calculations

5. **Oracle Verification**: All claims are verified by our oracle system:
   - Content meets requirements
   - Proper disclosure is present
   - No manipulation of metrics
   - Fair and transparent evaluation

### Technical Implementation

- **X OAuth**: Used only for identity verification and read-only access
- **Public Metrics**: Only accessed via official X API v2
- **No Automation**: No automated engagement or manipulation
- **Manual Review**: All claims reviewed by oracle before approval

### User Responsibilities

- **Creators**: Must include proper disclosure in all sponsored content
- **Developers**: Must not request engagement-based payments
- **Platform**: Ensures all transactions are transparent and compliant

### Monitoring and Enforcement

- Automated detection of missing disclosures
- Oracle verification of all claims
